          Hello! My name is Brad Molina, I'm a junior in highschool, and this is the website for my game. Some of my favorite things to do are play video games, 
          play soccer, and go to the gym. My favorite soccer team is FC Barcelona and my favorite video game is FIFA. Some of my favorite subjects in school are 
          history and science; I like to learn about how the world works and how its changed throughout time.
