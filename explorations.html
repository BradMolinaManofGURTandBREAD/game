    My group created a 3-4 player board game with the main objective being getting to the north star. 
    In order to acomplish the main objective you have to overcome obstacles placed by other players 
    and hope that you'll roll the right number. 
  </p>
  <h3>Initial Rules</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        3-4 players 
      </li> 
      <li>
        Each player must start at point labeled "start"
      </li>
      <li>(
        If a player rolls a 1, they are allowed to place an obstacle in front of an opponent player
      </li>
      <li>
        Each player has 2 obstacles max
      </li> 
      <li>
        If two players collide they must both roll the dice. Whoever gets the higher number moves and 
        the player that loses the duel must move back two spaces. 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Players can decide wether or not they want to go left, right, or forward (depending on where
        they are). 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        When a player is near the north star (the center) they must roll the exact number needed to get to the north star. 
      </li> 
   <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p> 
        The game was really fun, it would be better if it was a bigger board but we played a lot so it didnâ€™t matter in the 
        end. We liked that we were able to use obstacles to block players and how we had to fight one another if we collided.
